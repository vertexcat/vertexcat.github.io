The Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History (MAH) developed an engagement handbook--a manual describing the activities involved with each of the museum's programs and assessing those programs against five "engagement goals": **relevant, sustainable, bridging, participatory, and igniting**. (Read more about these goals on museum Executive Director Nina Simon's blog, [Museum 2.0](http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2014/09/what-are-your-engagement-goals.html).) I worked with Nina to translate the five goals into icons that form the backbone of the handbook content layout.
