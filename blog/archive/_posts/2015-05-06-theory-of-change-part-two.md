This is post two of two on the Theory of Change project with the Santa Cruz Museum of Art & History. [You can find post one here](/theory-of-change). 

The most crucial part of this project was to really get the information design right. The initial MS Office flowchart, packed with text, was a little overwhelming:

After working with the client to cut the theory down to its essential components, we agreed that a modified flowchart was the best approach for showing all of the possible paths.

Filling out the negative space and taking emphasis away from the arrows made the paths a little more clear. Standardizing flow chart block size was also important, to avoid introducing any unwanted information hierarchy. 

Although I usually work with vectors, I did most of this by hand (technical pen, brush) to give the piece an approachable, comic-book-type of style. This really aligns with the museum's brand, as [Ian David Moss of Fractured Atlas](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/) points out: 

> This infectious fun and enthusiasm pervade everything the MAH does - so much so that the standard PowerPoint visual style that we used for our own theories of change was deemed too lame to represent the brand. Ever resourceful, the MAH got an artist to create a rad graphic-novel-style version of it that could be used for sharing externally.

Here's some lettering warmups I did in technical pen, then a process shot of the final layout on illustration board.
