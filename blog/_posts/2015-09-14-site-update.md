Between wrapping up [#the100dayproject](/tags/#100-day-project) (ONE MORE) and getting ready for [Short Run](//shortrun.org) on October 31, a lot has been happening on this site. Here's the rundown: 

**Issue one of [Dish](/dish/) is complete**. How that came to be is a whole retexturing story I'll get into in another post, but for now you can get yourself a PDF copy for $1 on Gumroad ([details here](https://gumroad.com/l/yFAdg)). Print copies will be available at my table at Short Run and then online after that. 

The illustration section is looking a bit sparse, but that's a result of housekeeping - a lot of work has been edited, improved, and consolidated for your convenience and viewing pleasure. One fun new site feature is that I'm starting to embed Sketchfab models so you can look at things in 3D. Like this: 

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/63b03ca944cb4bd39fb991d063d3d603/embed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" onmousewheel=""></iframe>

Check back soon for more 3D models, a #the100dayproject wrap-up, the last process post for the Yellow Truck, and a couple of surprises!
