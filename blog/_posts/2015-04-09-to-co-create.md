[Elle Luna](http://elleluna.com/) and [The Great Discontent](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/) have launched [The 100 Day Project](https://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days): you commit to doing some kind of action and posting the results on Instagram every day for 100 consecutive days.

So far the [#the100dayproject](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/the100dayproject/) hashtag has been a great way to discover all of the amazing work that's out there. I'm following artists, designers, and other creators that I'm not sure I would have found without scrolling through #the100dayproject, and so many participants are  acknowledging each other's work with follows and comments - all facilitated by the Instagram (and Twitter) tags. 

I think watching people approach a single topic, concept, or medium in different ways every day is the best part, and the more specific the better. Some of the ones I like are: 

* [100 days of card concepts](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/100daysofcardconcepts/) by [@roshamboco](https://instagram.com/roshamboco/), including gems like "I show my lovin' via my oven"
* [100 days of cut paper](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/100daysofcutpaper/) by [@briannevp](https://instagram.com/briannevp/). My favorites so far are cut paper Link and cut paper Holly Golightly. 
* Beautiful city illustrations by [@nicemiceforyou](https://instagram.com/nicemiceforyou)
* ~~And there was one more that was 100 days of drawing faces on things. So much potential for hilarity, but I forgot to follow or bookmark!~~ Found it! [100 days of things with faces](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/100daysofthingswithfaces/) by [@hellopandreaa](https://instagram.com/hellopandreaa) is full of startled hot dogs and and distressed ice creams. 

I'm tackling 100 illustrations of 100 of my favorite things. So far, I have favorite drink, favorite coffee prep method, and favorite city I've visited:
