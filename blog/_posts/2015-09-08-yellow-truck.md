I have been expermenting a lot with more realistic shaders and modeling and am really happy with this personal project I started and finished over Labor Day weekend. First, the final image:

* [Grass Essentials by Blender Guru](http://www.blenderguru.com/product/grass-essentials/). Pricey, but worth the time saved!
* A [Node Wrangler](http://gregzaal.github.io/node-wrangler/) refresher, again by Greg Zaal, can be really helpful once you're dealing with clumps of 4 or 5 mix nodes.
* [This tip by AbdouBouam on dA](http://abdoubouam.deviantart.com/journal/pointiness-a-new-feature-in-blender-513224435) about using Geometry/Pointiness instead of dirty vertex colors.
* [How to model a car tire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhmRn-tYtxE) by Blender Guru. This is different than the videos currently in his [tutorial on modeling an entire car wheel](http://www.blenderguru.com/tutorials/how-to-make-a-car-wheel/), but check that out if you're modeling rims.

Next post: notes and process.
