![Sculpt January favorites so far](/images/blog/sculpt-january-favorites.jpg)

With Sculpt January almost over here is a look at the month to date. 

About a week in I decided to give up on drawing original concepts before sculpting, so everything has been fanart or developed from a preexisting concept. Both sculpting and drawing concepts are almost completely new for me, and I think trying to learn two things on the fly was... one too many. Afterwards, since I was able to just think about sculpting itself, the daily practice has been going a lot better! 

Towards the end of the month things got more consistent and colorful and clean - a reflection of better base mesh planning and multires handling. While I've always reused materials before I never really thought about appending lights and camera too. This came from observing other people's daily sculpts--the ones with a consistent style tended to be my favorite from day to day. 

The sculpts above are 7 of my favorites from the 26 (?) that I've finished so far. 
Credits follow, and more detailed sculpt notes will be on Tumblr.

- Chocobo, for "phoenix": This is based on the FFT chocobo. 
- Hayao Miyazaki, for "world improver": good ol' Google images for reference, but also very influenced by [Martin Hsu's](//www.martinhsu.com) "Miyazaki Club" t-shirt design. 
- Stitch from *Lilo and Stitch*, for "Disney": Fanart by [kaykaykit](http://kaykaykit.deviantart.com/) as reference.
- Lion from *Steven Universe*, for "cartoon animal": From "[Just Lion Things](http://cartoonnetwork.tumblr.com/post/120134102657/just-lion-things)" (links to Cartoon Network Tumblr).
- Kittenbus from *Mei and the Kittenbus*. 
- Sebastian from *Little Mermaid*, for "crustacean": Fanart by [koe-art](http://koe-art.blogspot.com/2012/02/sebastian-from-little-mermaid_20.html) as reference.
