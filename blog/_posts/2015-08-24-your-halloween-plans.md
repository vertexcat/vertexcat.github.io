Do you live in Seattle? Or, have you always wanted to visit Seattle but didn't know when the best time would be? Mark your calendar for October 31 because [Short Run](http://shortrun.org) is happening at Seattle Center! You can get your Space Needle/Chihuly/EMP on *and* check out zines, comix, books, prints, posters, art, and more from artists and writers near and far for free at Fisher Pavilion. 

If you need further convincing, here is an excellent poster by Jim Woodring:

I am still a little flabbergasted at the fact that I got off the exhibitor wait list for this festival and will be there in full force, selling as many books/prints/whatever else I can produce between now and October, while maybe possibly dressed as a yet to be disclosed character from Adventure Time. I would love to see you there! For updates and details, check out the festival website at [http://shortrun.org](http://shortrun.org).
