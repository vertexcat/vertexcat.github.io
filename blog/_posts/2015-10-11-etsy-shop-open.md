Somehow I finished everything I had to finish for Short Run a couple of weeks ahead of schedule, and while this does not give me a free pass out of Anxietyville come October 31 I did get a chance to open an Etsy shop ([link](//etsy.com/shop/cristaalejandre))! I've already posted about [Dish](/dish/) being complete, but everything is now physically in my possession and ready to rock. 

Here are some product images I finished today, including one for a project I have yet to post here (!):
