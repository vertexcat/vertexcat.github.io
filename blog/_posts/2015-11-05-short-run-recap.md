If I haven't mentioned it here before, [Short Run](http://www.shortrun.org/) was my *first tabling experience ever*. And it was great! The thought of sitting in a giant convention hall selling things to strangers is pretty intimidating, especially for my fellow introverts and anxiety-prone folks, but there was so much good going on that you don't even have room for the negatives.  

That said, I did make the mistake of not making time/space to walk around. In hindsight, I'd rather miss a few people walking by my table than miss all of the awesome zines and books and prints and 200+ vendors (I think?!) at Short Run. All of this to say, before you read any further, that this is really a **first-time-tabling recap** and not really a Short Run-specific one. If I come across some writeups about festival exhibitors, content, etc. I'll post links here. 

[**EDIT**: [here is a big list from the Comics Reporter!](http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/collective_memory_short_run_2015_2/)]

So perhaps this is false advertising. But I was, for a fact, the person wearing the foam fish hat for 8 hours on Saturday. 

Here are some of my post-festival thoughts, looking back on this first time tabling: 

###Some stuff I wish I had brought
* **A box or crate** instead of a bag. I thought I would take up less space with everything in a bag, but then I kept stepping on my extra books and stickers and stuff. 
* **A pillow**. For lumbar support... I'm definitely getting older. 
* **Cash box.** This one seems more optional, and a pouch or envelope is just fine, but it's nice to just pull organized bills out of their respective slots in the cash box... while you're excited that someone just bought your stuff and trying to make conversation and avoid giving $19 of change in dollar bills. 
* **More free stuff.** I have business cards, and lots of them were gone by the end. Hooray! But both of my table neighbors did some kind of giveaway with artwork--one used proofs as makeshift business cards and the other made buttons from misprints that were free with purchases. Muuuuuuch better than the recycling bin.
* **A little more attention to detail.** I don't think I was very consistent with tracking items sold, and there were probably other factors I overlooked, but in the end I ended up with about a $15 discrepancy (in the wrong direction). Good business involves planning for waste/error/loss, but I'm definitely still at the point where $15 is a lot! Sharing sales duty with a friend probably would have helped too--I didn't take many breaks and likely lost focus as a result.
* **A tablecloth.** They look nice with minimal effort, and the Short Run organizers even reminded everyone to bring one, but I forgot. Saved by my table neighbor, though. And, on that note:

###Some stuff that went really well

Lots of this happened through no effort of my own, but here we go: 

* **Great table neighbors!** I was sandwiched between beautifully risographed books by the fine folks at [Cold Cube Press](http://www.coldcubepress.com/) and the weirdly meta/mesmerizing Tinder zine by [Tony Morse](http://gluttonyremorse.com/). My biggest worries pre-Short Run was feeling like I only know how to exist as a visitor/customer at a festival and not a vendor, but being around good people = easy conversation and less fear. Just before the festival a friend reminded me that "it'll be just fine. You have mutual interests!"
* **Lots of 3D modelers.** I was really surprised by this. Last year when I went to Short Run I met artist/animator [Mari Ichimasu/Little Oze](http://www.littleoze.org/), and [Bruce Bickford](http://www.brucebickford.com/) was on this year's program, so I knew there must be some interest in 3D work among Short Run attendees. But I met at least half a dozen people who asked me specifically about Blender, 3D modeling, texturing, or lighting. I'm (still) so excited about this.
* **Tabling in costume.** I haven't worn a costume on Halloween (or at all) in years, and every professional instinct I had said "make a serious first impression" and "don't make yourself even more uncomfortable." Fortunately, I like to contradict myself and so I wore a giant fish hat and a little street food stall attached to my chest and sold books and stickers as a taiyaki (beanfish) stand. This went *really* well--other than the fact that it's just fun, I think doing something so out of the ordinary made it easier for me to switch to a calm and collected "work mode". 
* **Holy costumes, Batman!** Short Run people, you all know how to do Halloween right. Yeesh. Some great Adventure Time and Steven Universe duo and group costumes, a "normal-looking" person with six eyes, three noses, and three pairs of glasses (all extremely realistic or actually real), a family with Totoro and Porco Rosso parents and a Pikachu kid... thank you, Short Run organizers, for making it all happen on Halloween. And thank you, costumed Short-Run-goers, for being awesome. 
* I brought **so many snacks** that even though I ate 3/4 of it before the doors opened I still had plenty left. Short Run is only one day, but it is A Day. It's also good to stay hydrated :thumbsup:

Even though my day job will probably pick up between now and the new year, this whole Short Run experience is really great motivation to make/do/share/print more. Onto the next project!
