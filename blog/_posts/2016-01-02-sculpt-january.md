One thing I learned in 2015 is that practice does make you a lot better at a thing you're not good at--<small>a lesson I somehow missed during 4 years of being a music performance major, but that's a different story</small>. So I was really excited to learn about Sculpt January from [Blendernation](http://www.blendernation.com/2015/12/19/sculpt-january-2016/)!

For each day of the month there is a predetermined topic. You sculpt it and post on Facebook and/or anywhere else. That's it! There's a [dedicated Sculpt January Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sculptjanuary), and even though I rarely use Facebook it's nice to have everybody's submissions, discussions, questions, etc. on one page. My first two sculpts for days one and two ("mushroom" and "tentacle") are pictured above! I have also been on a concept art kick so this is a nice chance to stretch definitions and make some fun characters and props. January is already pretty busy so I'm not super confident about getting through 31 days of sculpting, but this covers two things I've been wanting to practice and it's been really fun so far so I want to make it a priority!
