A BIG content update happened today! I drank the Blender Kool-Aid and am going full-blown 3D. 

The main page also uses a modified version of [this neat image grid setup from Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/05/15/recreating-the-design-samsung-grid-loading-effect/), which involves an infinite scroll, hover animations, and (THE best part) an image reveal effect that's based on the dominate color of that image. Head back to [the main page](http://crista-alejandre.com) and scroll up and down to check it out.
