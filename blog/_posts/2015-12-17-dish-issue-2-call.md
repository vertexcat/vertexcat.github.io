### Share a recipe or story!

Issue 2 of Dish: A Food Appreciation Zine will be an **illustrated collection of contributed stories** (or descriptions, recipes, etc.) and I would love to hear about a favorite or interesting dish in *your* life. Drinks are fine too–it just has to be something that’s prepared in some way. 

What you send can be as short as two or three sentences, so **tell me about your favorite dish or your stories about making/enjoying/sharing food or drink!** Unfortunately I can't pay you for submitting something, but I will send you a print copy of the finished zine wherever you are in the world.

Email [hello@crista-alejandre.com](//mailto:hello@crista-alejandre.com) by December 24, 2015. Hope to hear from you soon!
