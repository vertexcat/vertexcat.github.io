While I have very mixed feelings about the role fanart plays in a creator's body of work,[*](#soapbox) I do think it at least makes for really great practice.

Here's a collection of the fan art I've done during [100 Days of My Favorite Things](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/100daysofmft/), featuring characters and designs from/by: San-X, Pokemon, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Polar Bear Cafe, My Neighbor Totoro, the doge meme, and a Weezer album cover. Enjoy!

<a name="soapbox">*</a>Fan art is such a complicated topic (and might get another post in the future), but for a slew of reasons (IP/creator/owner's rights, commercial exploitation, ethics) it's generally [frowned](http://graphicleftovers.com/blog/fan-art-vs-copyright-infringement-legal/) [upon](http://www.animationcareerreview.com/articles/10-mistakes-avoid-when-creating-your-online-portfolio) in professional portfolios. But there's some gray area in the definition of transformative-ness (see Graphics Leftovers "[Fanart vs. Copyright Infringement](http://graphicleftovers.com/blog/fan-art-vs-copyright-infringement-legal/)"). And what if the work was commissioned for a show or project? (See [this](http://forum.deviantart.com/art/general/1887904/) DeviantArt post.) And it seems to be more of an accepted practice in game development (see [this](http://www.polycount.com/forum/showthread.php?t=76042) and [this](http://www.polycount.com/forum/showthread.php?t=85725) Polycount thread). That said, fan art creation is an incredibly powerful and important way for fans to participate in dialogue and community building--it just needs to exist in a way that respects the creator and owner.
