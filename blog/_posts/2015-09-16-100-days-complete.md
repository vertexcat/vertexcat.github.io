![100 days of my favorite things, for the 100 day project](/images/blog/100-days-complete.png)

Here are all <s>100</s> 104 projects for my first [#100dayproject](/blog/100-day-project)! (I guess I miscounted, or thought Instagram tracked things incorrectly, so really I hit 100 about 3 weeks ago. But giving 104% doesn't hurt, right?)

You can look at each one online or through the Instagram app through [this link](//instagram.com/explore/tags/100daysofmft). This was a marathon of showing up, powering through those days when you get home and don't feel like you have a favorite-anything, letting a project run long while keeping anxiety and pressure low, and most importantly learning new and awesome things. A bit relieved, mostly proud. Great experience!
