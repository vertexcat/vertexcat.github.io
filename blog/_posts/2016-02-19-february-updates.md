First, [my 2016 Sculpt January album!](https://plus.google.com/photos/116283228796321454963/album/6246591929294146065) I picked my favorites and uploaded them to the main page on this site, but for completion's sake all 31 are in that album. While not all 31 are my best work the progression is a pretty interesting record of this very boot-camp like (to me) experience. Plus, as I think I've mentioned before, I'm a big fan of this learn by doing with a sprinkling of peer pressure sort of thing and feel that it's good for my brain, confidence, and portfolio! 

In other news I started a new blog called [Rigged Exhibits](http://rigged-exhibits.tumblr.com/) to document my game projects, because game dev is a pretty new thing for me and I feel less self-conscious writing about things breaking/being buggy/not the right color on a Tumblr than this site. But I think I'll end up with some fun proofs of concepts (or finished games??) and definitely am going to keep trying to get involved with game art now and in the future. 

Finally, I've been doing a lot of web dev lately and am really excited and inspired about finally understanding all of these wonderful, time- and headache-saving tools--particularly Gulp, Bower, Yeoman, and Jade. I'm not sure if posts about web dev belong on this blog but for me it's been a big part of running my own freelance business (and saving a good chunk of change in web design and hosting). So maybe more on this in the future, maybe not. Send me a tweet if you feel strongly about this!
