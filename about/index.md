#About

Hello! I am a freelance illustrator based in Seattle, Washington. Drawing from a love of animation and video game art and design, I produce both stylized and semi-realistic imagery by digitally modeling subjects and environments in 3D, painting or photocompositing textures, and processing the final image in Photoshop. 

Check out the [#3D](/tags/#3d) or [#process](/tags/#process) tags on my blog if you're interested in more details about this workflow!  

I also draw comics and illustrations more traditionally - digitally or by hand in 2D. You can see many personal and client projects [here](/2D/).

#Credits and Resources

For anyone who wants to get their feet wet with 3D sculpting, texturing, and animation, [Blender](//blender.org) is an incredible free and open source program that lets you give all of these areas a try. It has come a long way in terms of features and usability, and while it is by no means an industry standard it is a great way to learn and practice some of the core concepts that are shared between Blender and the bigger names like Maya and Max. The vast majority of the 3D images on this site were at least modeled in Blender, if not created there from start to finish. 

This site runs on [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com) through [Github Pages](//pages.github.com). There's a bit of a learning curve, but it's a great free platform for non-database client-side website building. If you're interested in more details, [here's the readme](//github.com/hicrista/hicrista.github.io) for the site repository.
