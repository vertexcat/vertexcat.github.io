#About

Hello! I'm Crista Alejandre and I'm an illustrator, designer, and 3D artist. My specific interests and strengths are currently **3D modeling, hand-painted textures, lettering and typography, and vector graphics.** 

With these skillsets I've had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of personal and freelance projects. Some examples include **self-publishing comics and zines, designing business cards and other marketing collaterial, illustrating infographics, and creating 2D and 3D video game assets.** Clients I've worked with have ranged from individuals and small businesses to museums, universities, and professional associations. 

Recently I've started to learn Unity and C# by working on a couple of personal game projects! Most of this is documented on my game dev Tumblr [Rigged Exhibits](http://rigged-exhibits.tumblr.com/). 

Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you're interested in working together on a current or future project!
