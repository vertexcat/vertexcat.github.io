The [Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History](http://www.santacruzmah.org/) (MAH) developed an engagement handbook&emdash;a manual describing the activities involved with each of the museum's programs and assessing those programs against five "engagement goals": **relevant, sustainable, bridging, participatory, and igniting**. ([Read more about these goals on museum Executive Director Nina Simon's blog, Museum 2.0](http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2014/09/what-are-your-engagement-goals.html).) I worked with Nina to translate the five goals into icons that form the backbone of the handbook content layout.

At the museum's request, all layout design was implemented in Microsoft Word. The handbook includes an introduction, table of contents, section dividers, and content pages.
