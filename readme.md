##hicrista.github.io

Source code for my illustration (and other work) portfolio site, http://www.crista-alejandre.com. It is currently hosted through Github Pages and powered by Jekyll. 

I'm also using this project to improve my Git skills and learn Markdown. 

####Quick Reference
* This is a user page and does not require the gh-pages branch to go live
* The index is currently set to display illustrations only (ie it uses the illustration layout)
* Thumbnails are 525 x 323 px
* .scss files are separated into partials by the affected site section (eg navigation, footer)
* Post markdown files are currently in one folder, whereas images are separated by category (Issue #1)
