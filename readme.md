My illustration portfolio at http://www.crista-alejandre.com. 
It is currently hosted through Github Pages and powered by Jekyll. 

This is an ongoing learning experience! 

###Notes about Quirks
As [Joshua Lande describes here](http://joshualande.com/short-urls-jekyll/), in order to get clean URLs (especially to make a Jekyll site look more like a portfolio and less like a blog) each post requires a permalink entry in the YAML front matter. 

The illustration and comics galleries are identical except for part of the image path and the `<ul>` ID called by the GridScrollFx function. Eventually the Liquid tags should be more dynamic and the two galleries merged into one layout.
