These were some of my (favorite!) entries in Sculpt January 2016, an event where participants digitally or physically create one sculpture for every day in January. The topics are predetermined by the event organizers. 

All 31 of my entries are [in this Google album](https://plus.google.com/photos/116283228796321454963/album/6246591929294146065), and you can [learn more about the event from the organizers AgenZasBrothers](https://agenzasbrothers.com/en/sculptjanuary-2016/).
