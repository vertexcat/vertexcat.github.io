Original concept.

This was my first entry in Sculpt January 2016, an annual event where participants digitally or physically create one sculpture every day in January. The topics are predetermined by the [event creators/organizers AgenZasBrothers. Read more about the challenge from the source!](https://agenzasbrothers.com/en/sculptjanuary-2016/)
