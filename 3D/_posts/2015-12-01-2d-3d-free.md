Learning new things all the time is a pretty big part of who I am and what I do. But that can be a very expensive way of life! It's important to be able to experiment and fail when learning something new, without the fear of messing up or wasting a bunch of money. But with digital art and design, as with many other fields, industry standard software almost always comes at a premium price. 

Fortunately, there are many high quality, well-maintained tools and resources available for free. This zine provides an overview of what's out there, how free software stacks up with paid ones, and a "reading list" of artists and designers who use these tools in their personal and professional work.
