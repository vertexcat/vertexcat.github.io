I consider myself really lucky to live so close to Volunteer Park in Seattle. This shows some of the highlights of this park: the Seattle Asian Art Museum, Volunteer Park Conservatory, and water tower are all worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. The famous Noguchi sculpture and some koi ponds are in front of the Museum, and you can often find kids playing, summer camp activities, and adorable dogs all over the park. This part of Capitol Hill also makes for a pleasant bike ride, though I wish you the best of luck getting back up the hill once you go down.
