I went in search of a file-based CMS and ended up back in GitHub's arms--did you know that you get [a free user/organization site and unlimited project sites](https://pages.github.com/) through Github? So I made myself a website. More details on the [repository page](https://github.com/hicrista/hicrista.github.io).
