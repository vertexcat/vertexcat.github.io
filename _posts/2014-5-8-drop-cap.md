Imagined book cover for *Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell* by Susanna Clarke, with symbols of old magic and the characters who wield it. 

Inspired by [Jessica Hische's](http://jessicahische.is) work on [Penguin Drop Caps](http://www.penguin.com/static/pages/classics/penguindropcaps.php) and prompted by the Skillshare class [Lettering for Designers: One Drop Cap at a Time](http://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Lettering-for-Designers-One-Drop-Cap-Letterform-at-a-Time/1412984025).
