This was created for Spoonflower's utensil-themed pattern contest. I went to college in Maryland and always loved sitting down to a big box of blue crabs with friends and some beers. I chose this experience as inspiration because the little wooden crab hammer is such a strange (fun!) utensil, and eating seafood in general involves some pretty unique tools. 

The beach and nautical colorways shown here will be available for sale on Spoonflower soon!
