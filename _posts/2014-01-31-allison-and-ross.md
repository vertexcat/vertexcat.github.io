Full website redesign for a Seattle-based small business specializing in custom framing, art restoration, installation, and other fine art services. Thanks to Foundation 5, the site features a responsive navigation bar and layout. Check [the repository](http://github.com/hicrista/allison-ross) for this site on Github for jQuery plugin credits and more details.

I was also responsible for updating much of the product and service photography and editing copy on the site.
