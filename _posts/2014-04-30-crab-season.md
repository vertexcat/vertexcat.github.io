This was created for Spoonflower's utensil-themed pattern contest and is also a throwback to my college days in Maryland. I chose this experience as inspiration because the little wooden crab hammer is such a strange (fun!) utensil, and eating seafood in general involves some pretty unique tools. 

The beach and nautical colorways shown here will be available for sale on Spoonflower soon.
